						<h2>What is GFD?</h2>
						<p> GFD is a group that started on season 3 of the Gamemode 4 Public Server, with the founding members: MightyBurger, Internet_Alien, SirSheepe and RedstoneSlimeMC.
						<br /> However, the story doesn't start with GFD as we know it, it instead starts with the construction of EHXP (Extreme Hills XP Farm), and a group looking into attaching farms called EHF (Extreme Hills Farming) set up by our founding members. They planned amongst other things to build a gold farm towering above EHXP, however EHF decided that it would be a bit of an eyesore and not enough space to cram all of this on top of EHXP. Red came up with another suggestion - build it all on top of his guardian farm. Liking this idea, they moved there. However, no longer in extreme hills, they decided that they needed to chose a new name. Suggestions like GFS: Global Farming Society or GFS: Global Farming System flew out before Internet suggested the name we have grown to love; GFD: Global Farming Department 
						<br /> From there GFD grew, completing one of the largest and coolest places on the server. Since then, GFD has decided to branch off of GM4 and start creating even more projects, such as creating Team GFD.</p>
